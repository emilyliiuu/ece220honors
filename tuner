In this program, a simple pitch tuner will be implemented. Using concert A
as a reference point (the most common pitch in modern music), the closest 
note to the pitch being recieved in the microphone will be calculated using
a formula derived using the equal temperament, 12 tone scale, with each note
being a half step from the previous.
